    <!-- Background Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Accra,  attending St. Sylvanus R/C School in my early years. The school helped me to realize that the world of technology was advancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I begun learning C++ and python to build my programming skills. But my time with programming came to a halt when I gained admission into St. Augustine's College. At the college, I was highly engaged in NSMQ (National Science and Math Quiz) activities so I did not have time for programming. </br>
        My high school life ended with me leading the college to place second in the NSMQ 2024. With this, I quickly went back to my programming life.

      <h2>What I Do Now</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a first year computer engineering student at Kwame  Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-KNUST. <br/>
        Outside of school, I develop the front-end for mobile applications using flutter. Although, I am still in training, I have the appropriate skills to build a functional mobile app.
        I am also working on databases using SQL to gain more insight into back-end.

    <!-- Why I Chose Engineering Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why I Chose Computer Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        I chose computer engineering because it allows me to combine creativity with problem-solving. Engineering is not just about building things; it's about creating solutions that improve lives and push the boundaries of what's possible. The ability to turn ideas into reality is what drives me every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineering also offers endless opportunities for learning and growth. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, exploring cutting-edge technologies, or tackling complex challenges, there's always something new to discover. This dynamic nature of engineering keeps me motivated and excited about the future.
